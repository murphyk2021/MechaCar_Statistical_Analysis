# AutosRUs: Analysis of Production Data
## Module 15:  Statistics and R

### Overview of Project 

In this module we practiced using RStudio to perform statistical analyses.  Upon completion of our practice, we were given a dataset which contains the mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars to determine what is blocking the progress of the manufacturing team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
After determining multiple regressions it can be determined that the vehicle length and the ground clearance appear to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values as their slopes are not 0 and the absolute value of the t test is quite small.  According to this analysis, vehicle weight and AWD appear to have a slope very close to zero and provide a random amount of variance to the mpg values.
